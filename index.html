        <h2>Computational Thinking</h2>
        <p>There are four parts to computational thinking:</p>

        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>Decomposition involves breaking down a problem into smaller tasks that are easier to solve</p>
        
        <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
        <p>Take solutions to previous problems and apply relevant solutions/methods to solving the current problem.</p>
        
        <h3>Abstraction</h3>
        <p>Make sure we focus on relevant information and disregard details that won't help with the current task.</p>

        <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>Once we've developed a possible solution, we test it and continue to iterate on it to find possible mistakes/bugs and more efficient solutions.</p>

      <section class="card" id="agile">
        <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
        <p>Agile is a set of frameworks and practices for approaching the build and delivery of a product. 
           Agile has a focus on adaptability, collaboration, and self-organization.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <h4>User Stories</h4>
        <P>Work is broken down into incremental parts. Physically these might be an index card or sticky note with a brief description of the intended functionality. 
          They serve as the basis for “incremental software delivery”.</P>

        <h4>Incremental Development</h4>
        <p>An approach to software development in which projects are built while maintaining functionality with each iteration that is “user-visible”.</p>
        
        <h4>Daily Meeting</h4>
        <p>Team convenes each day to bring everyone up to date on information crucial to coordination. Each member briefly describes “completed” contributions and obstacles.</p>

        <h4>Iterative Development</h4>
        <p>An approach to software development in which while adding new features/products, we also revisit older features, possibly refactoring/rebuilding them.</p>

        <h4>Milestone Retrospective</h4>
        <p>After a project has been active for some time, permanent members of the teams take a few days to create a detailed report of the project's progress/significant events so far.</p>

        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>In situations where user experience is a major factor, personas (made up users) are used to maintain an anchor/focus for design choices. Personas provide a distinct 
          user expectation as to avoid vague design choices for “ease of use” or “the user” that would ultimately compromise the integrity of the product.</p>
      
        <h3>Agile Manifesto</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <b>Customer</b> collaboration over contract negotiation
        </blockquote>
         
        <blockquote>
          <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan
        </blockquote>
